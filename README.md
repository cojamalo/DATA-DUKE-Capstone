# Project description from Coursera:

For this assignment, you will need to imagine that you are a statistical consultant who has recently been hired by a real estate investment firm based in Ames, Iowa. They have had an intern collect and collate all of the recent house sales in Ames and have put together a large spreadsheet that contains the sale price of each house along with many of its physical features. Your employers want you to take this data and develop a model to predict the selling price of a given home. They hope to use this information to help assess whether the asking price of a house is higher or lower than the true value of the house. If the home is undervalued, it may be a good investment for the firm.

Your employers are savvy and have been successfully investing in real estate for a long time but they hope a more model-based approach will help focus their search, improving efficiency and the bottom line. The firm plans to use a combination of your model and industry professional expertise to make its investment decisions. Because of this, the firm is not willing to accept a black box solution - they have specified that they must be able to understand the details of your model, including its strengths and its weaknesses. None of the current employees at the firm have any experience or expertise in statistics, statistical inference or modeling - for example you should not assume they will know what a p-value or a linear regression is. As such you will need to explain all of your approaches in layman's terms throughout this project.
